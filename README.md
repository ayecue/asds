*generic:

**events
- once a day you get money (x = onlinetime * stations passed)
- there are random events where you have to do mini quests like driving to a certain station to get money
- there are also other events where you just have to buy money or get some money

**pot
- the money pot will appear on random stations, as soon you arrive you'll get all money in the pot


**buy trainstations
- you have to reactivate them after a certain time 72h/48h/24h
- reactive time depends on ownership time (the longer you own a station the shorter is the time interval)
- if you got no money you can sell your trainstation to the bank (during this time you'll get no money from other players)
- you can also sell/trade your stations with other players (the only condition is that you have to visit the trainstation you want to trade during the next 24 hours)
- when you own three stations in a row (every station have to be in a radius of 5km to each other) you will be able to upgrade your stations


**archievements
- for example:
Small Buisness: You just buyed 5 stations.
Medium Buisness: You just buyed 10 stations.
Big Buisness: You just buyed 15 stations.
